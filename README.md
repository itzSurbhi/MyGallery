# My Gallery Project

This is a simple and elegant **Image Gallery** project created using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The gallery displays a collection of images styled as cards with captions. On hovering over each image, the grayscale filter is removed and a subtle drop shadow appears, highlighting the image.

### Features:
- Responsive image gallery layout using CSS Flexbox.
- Images appear grayscale by default with a smooth transition to full color on hover.
- Each image has a caption overlay that fades in when hovered.
- Styled with rounded corners and shadow effects for an attractive look.

## File Structure

- `gallery.html` – The main HTML file containing the gallery markup.
- `gallery.css` – The CSS stylesheet that styles the gallery and cards.
- `My Gallery_files/` – Folder containing the image files shown in the gallery.

## How to Use

1. Open `gallery.html` in any modern web browser.
2. View the gallery with images displayed in a neat grid.
3. Hover over any image to see the grayscale effect removed and the caption appear.
